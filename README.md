# binary_search_trees

This is a exercise in javascript in building, manipulatng, searching, and rebalancing
binary search trees. Everything is outputted to the console. To run the program, please
call the function runProgram() in the console. This will generate a balanced binary search tree
and will log the tree in level order, post order, pre order, and in order. Then, the program
unbalances the tree, rebalances the tree, and re-logs all of the various traversal methods.

I primarily implemented the BST methods using recursion.
